          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            To provide our legal and immigration assistance services, Lex collects and processes specific categories of personal and technical information:
          </p>
          
          <h3>a. Identity & Contact Information</h3>
          <p>
            We collect your full name, email address, country of residence, and preferred language to personalize your experience and ensure accurate jurisdiction-based support.
          </p>
          
          <h3>b. Uploaded Documents & Scanned Media</h3>
          <p>
            Documents you upload or scan (e.g., PDFs, images) are securely processed to extract relevant legal information. These files are used solely for generating context-specific responses and are not reused for unrelated purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>c. Geolocation & IP Data</h3>
          <p>
            Lex may access your IP address or device-based location data to determine your jurisdiction, present relevant legal information, and display local resources. Location data is never used for advertising or behavioral tracking.
          </p>
          
          <h3>d. Device & Technical Information</h3>
          <p>
            We collect standard technical details, including browser type, OS version, IP address, session time, and app usage data, to ensure platform security and performance.
          </p>
          
          <h3>e. AI Interaction Logs</h3>
          <p>
            User inputs and AI-generated responses are logged to improve system accuracy, ensure responsible usage, and support safety monitoring. These logs are never used for profiling or marketing.
          </p>
          
          <h3>f. Feature Usage Data</h3>
          <p>
            Lex monitors which tools you use (e.g., SOS help, document analysis, chat) to enhance product development and user experience.
          </p>
          
          <h3>g. Camera Access</h3>
          <p>
            When scanning documents, camera access is requested strictly for capturing document images. No facial data or background visuals are stored or analyzed.
          </p>
          
          <h3>h. Translation Logs</h3>
          <p>
            When using Lex's translation feature, your text is temporarily processed to complete translation requests. These logs are securely discarded after the session.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            Lex processes your information solely to deliver, enhance, and secure the services we provide. Our use of your data aligns strictly with the platform's core legal support functions.
          </p>
          
          <h3>a. Service Delivery & Personalization</h3>
          <p>
            We use your documents, location, and language preferences to generate accurate AI-powered responses, provide jurisdiction-specific legal support, and translate materials as needed.
          </p>
          
          <h3>b. Platform Performance & Reliability</h3>
          <p>
            Technical and usage data helps us ensure stability, resolve system issues, and improve functionality based on real-world usage.
          </p>
          
          <h3>c. Support & Communications</h3>
          <p>
            Your contact details are used to provide user support, respond to inquiries, and send important updates. We do not send promotional materials unless you opt in.
          </p>
          
          <h3>d. Legal & Regulatory Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            We process data as required by applicable laws, including consumer protection, digital services regulations, and lawful disclosure obligations.

          <h3>e. Security & Abuse Prevention</h3>
          <p>
            Lex monitors usage patterns to detect and prevent misuse, enforce platform integrity, and respond to suspicious activity or abuse.
          </p>
          
          <h3>f. AI Quality & Fairness</h3>
          <p>
            AI interaction logs are reviewed (in pseudonymized form) to improve accuracy, reduce bias, and enhance model performance. We do not use identifiable data for AI training without explicit consent.
          </p>
          
          <h3>g. Emergency Support Functionality</h3>
          <p>
            For users activating the SOS feature, location and session data is used to display local legal resources and assist in urgent situations—handled with the highest confidentiality.
          </p>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            Lex is committed to full compliance with applicable international data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), among others.
          </p>
          <p>
            We process your personal data only when there is a valid legal basis to do so. The specific legal bases under which we process personal information are as follows:
          </p>

                    <h3>a. Contractual Necessity</h3>
          <p>
            We process certain personal information to fulfill our contractual obligations to you. This includes enabling you to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Upload, scan, and receive legal document analysis</li>
            <li>Access translated legal assistance based on your country of residence</li>
            <li>Use location-based features and SOS services</li>
            <li>Interact with the AI assistant for real-time legal guidance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where you use Lex in reliance on our Terms of Use, this processing is essential to deliver the agreed-upon services.
          </p>

                    <h3>b. Legitimate Interests</h3>
          <p>
            In certain cases, we process your data to pursue our legitimate business interests, provided those interests do not override your rights and freedoms. These interests include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improving platform performance and reliability</li>
            <li>Securing the application against fraud, misuse, or legal liability</li>
            <li>Monitoring AI interactions to ensure safety, accuracy, and fairness</li>
            <li>Facilitating internal analytics and service innovation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We conduct careful balancing assessments to ensure that our interests do not compromise your privacy or data protection rights.
          </p>

                    <h3>c. Legal Obligations</h3>
          <p>
            We may process or retain your data when we are legally required to do so. This includes obligations under:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Civil, consumer protection, or digital services regulations</li>
            <li>Tax, anti-fraud, or anti-money laundering laws</li>
            <li>Mandatory reporting obligations for certain jurisdictions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When we are compelled by law, we ensure the minimum amount of personal data is disclosed and that appropriate safeguards are in place.
          </p>

                    <h3>d. Consent</h3>
          <p>
            Where your explicit consent is required for certain processing activities—such as receiving marketing communications or enabling optional feature tracking—we obtain this consent clearly and transparently. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@lexhelps.com" class="website-link">support@lexhelps.com</a> or adjusting your in-app settings. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out prior to such withdrawal.
          </p>

          <h3>e. Public Interest and Vital Interest (where applicable)</h3>
          <p>
            In rare instances, such as emergency use of the SOS function, we may process limited data necessary to protect a user's vital interest or to act in the public interest—such as connecting the user to legal aid in critical legal distress situations. In such cases, processing is proportionate, limited in scope, and handled with the highest sensitivity.
          </p>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Lex does not sell your personal data under any circumstances.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We only share your information with trusted third-party service providers who support our platform—for example, cloud hosting, analytics, AI processing, and customer support. These providers are contractually bound to use your data solely for delivering services on our behalf and must meet strict confidentiality and security standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also disclose personal information if required by law, court order, or government request, or to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enforce our Terms of Use</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud, abuse, or threats to platform integrity</li>
            <li>Protect the rights and safety of Lex, its users, or others</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the event of a merger, acquisition, or restructuring, your data may be transferred to a successor entity, with notice provided where required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lex does not share user data with advertisers or business partners for marketing purposes without your explicit consent. In limited cases, we may work with region-specific legal advisors or translators—always under strict confidentiality.
          </p>
          <p>
            All sharing practices comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable privacy laws.

        </section>

        <section class="section">
          <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Lex retains your personal data only as long as necessary to deliver our services, meet legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uploaded documents and legal queries are kept only for the time required to support your use of the platform—unless a longer retention period is required by law or needed for audit, compliance, or dispute resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inactive accounts may lead to your data being archived in a pseudonymized or anonymized form for internal analytics or compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We regularly review our retention policies to ensure they align with applicable laws, best practices, and evolving user needs. You may request data deletion at any time, subject to legal exceptions.

        <section class="section">
          <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            As Lex is accessible globally, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including jurisdictions where data protection laws may be less comprehensive than those in your home country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where such transfers occur, we take appropriate measures to ensure that your information remains protected in accordance with applicable data protection laws. These measures may include entering into data transfer agreements using Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, relying on adequacy decisions, or ensuring that recipients are certified under recognized data protection frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using Lex, you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of your personal data to jurisdictions outside your own, including to the United States, where our core infrastructure and service providers are located.

        <section class="section">
          <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
          <p>
            We implement a range of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These include, but are not limited to, encrypted transmission using Transport Layer Security (TLS), secure storage of documents and user data, access controls based on the principle of least privilege, and regular system monitoring and penetration testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we follow industry best practices to secure your information, no system of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for restricting access to your devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we become aware of any unauthorized access or data breach involving your personal information, we will notify you in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

          <h2>10. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Disclosures</h2>
          <p>
            Lex incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) technologies as a core component of its legal and immigration support services. These features are essential to the functionality of the platform and are used to assist with document analysis, translation, and jurisdiction-based informational guidance.
